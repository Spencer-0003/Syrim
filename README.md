## Self-hosting
<div align="center">

    You are not allowed to re-upload Syrim to bot lists such as top.gg and self hosting support will not be provided.

### Requirements

- [`PostgreSQL`]: To store data.

## Support Syrim

### Starring/forking
Any stars/forks of Syrim are appreciated as they help the project grow. 

### Donations
Using the bot is free but providing the bot is not. Syrim will never lock commands behind a pay-wall so donations are the only way of making an income. All donations are appreciated!
